I was thinking what kind of project I could create that i would be using.
When i first started fishing I always forgot what kind of rod or bait i needed for each kind of fish, so in this project I created this web application where the user can
choose one of the predator fish we have here in germany and get all the info he needs to catch one!

I stored all the data about the fish in an array which holds all the fish in objects inside of it.
Then I used template strings to display it on the page.
When the user clicks on a button through e.target method checks the id of the dataset that got clicked and then uses the id as an argument in a function which then renders
the object on the page.
